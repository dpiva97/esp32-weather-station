# esp32-weather-station
Weather station builded with these components:

-ESP32 (Main board)
-BME280 (Humidity and pressure sensor)
-DS18B20 (Temperature sensor)

The weather station can send the data to a rest api.
I use these custom rest api made with nodeJs : (todo add link of repository)
for store the data in a postgresql database and send data to weathercloud https://app.weathercloud.net/d7617132597#current 
You can send data directly to weathercloud
