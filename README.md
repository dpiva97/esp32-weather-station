# esp32-weather-station
Weather station builded with these components: <br />

- ESP32 (Main board)
- BME280 (Humidity and pressure sensor)
- DS18B20 (Temperature sensor)

The weather station can send the data to a rest api. <br />
I use these custom rest api made with nodeJs : (todo add link of repository) <br />
for store the data in a postgresql database and send data to weathercloud (https://app.weathercloud.net/d7617132597#current) <br />
You can send data directly to weathercloud
